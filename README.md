# Mission Statement

## Personal Mission

It is all for my recovery. I handover my will to the power of god and let him show me how to live. 

## Company Mission

**Enable developers to develop, operate and monetise decentralised applications.**

## Company Name

The company is called BlockFabrik. Block, from blockchain and Fabrik is German for factory. 

## Context

Decentralised applications, short dapps, are part of Web 3.0 where smart contracts run on the blockchain. A smart contract may contain business logic and storage as we know it from Web 2.0 counterparts such as Gmail. The difference between Web 3.0 and Web 2.0 is, Web 3.0 applications run decentralised on the blockchain rather than on a centralised system like Google. This may shift power away from big companies and help rebalance the world as we know it today. 

## Problem statement

Many different blockchains exist. A dapp may depend on several blockchains. Blockchains still run on servers, so-called block chain nodes. Operating such nodes is a time and cost intesive endevour. A developer rather wants to focus on solving a problem for end-users than setting up blockchain nodes. Blockchain infrastructure is a commodity.

## MVP Product: decon.sh

Decon stands for "Decentralised Connectivity" and .sh is the top-level domain of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. The file extension .sh is used linux bash scripts as well e.g. start.sh.

## Product Vision for decode.sh

**Give developers access to a best-priced blockchain node infrastrucure and be the "Toiletpaper of blockchain infrastructure"**
