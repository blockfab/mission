# Mission Statement

## Personal Mission

*"It is my recovery. I hand over my will and my life to my higher power and let it show me how to live."* 

## Company Mission

*"Enable developers to develop, operate and monetise decentralised applications."*

## Company Name

The company is called BlockFabrik. Block, from blockchain and Fabrik is German for factory. 

## Context

Decentralised applications, short dapps, are part of Web 3.0 where smart contracts run on the blockchain. A smart contract may contain business logic and storage as we know it from Web 2.0 counterparts such as Gmail. The difference between Web 3.0 and Web 2.0 is, Web 3.0 applications run decentralised on the blockchain rather than on a centralised system like Google. This may shift power away from big companies and help rebalance the world as we know it today. 

## Problem statement

Many different blockchains exist. A dapp may depend on several blockchains. Blockchains still run on servers, so-called block chain nodes. Operating such nodes is a time and cost intesive endevour. Developers rather want to focus on solving problems for end-users than setting up blockchain nodes. Blockchain infrastructure is a commodity.

## MVP Product: decon.sh

Decon stands for "Decentralised Connectivity" and .sh is the top-level domain of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. The file extension .sh is used for linux shell scripts e.g. start.sh.

## Product Vision for decode.sh

*"Give developers access to best-priced blockchain node infrastrucure, be the toilet paper of Web 3.0"*
